## Hypothesis Testing?
Hypothesis testing is a **statistical method** used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It helps us determine whether an observed effect is real or due to random chance.

#### Why is Hypothesis Testing Important?
- It allows researchers to **test claims** or theories.
- It helps in **decision-making** based on data.
- It is widely used in **science, business, medicine, and engineering**.

#### Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. **Formulate Hypotheses**
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Assumes no effect or no difference.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)**: Represents the claim we are testing for.

2. **Choose a Significance Level (α)**
   - Common values: **0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%)**.
   - This is the probability of making a **Type I error** (false positive).

3. **Select a Test Statistic & Distribution**
   - Depending on the data, we use **t-tests, z-tests, chi-square tests, etc.**
   - The test statistic (e.g., *t* or *z*) measures how extreme the sample result is.

4. **Compute the Test Statistic and p-value**
   - The **p-value** tells us the probability of observing the result if *H₀* is true.
   - A small p-value (**< α**) suggests evidence **against** *H₀*.

5. **Make a Decision**
   - If **p-value < α** → Reject *H₀* (evidence supports *H₁*).
   - If **p-value ≥ α** → Fail to reject *H₀* (not enough evidence).

#### Example: Testing a New Drug

A pharmaceutical company wants to test if a new drug lowers blood pressure.

- **Step 1: Define Hypotheses**
  - *H₀*: The new drug has no effect on blood pressure (*μ = 120*).
  - *H₁*: The new drug lowers blood pressure (*μ < 120*).

- **Step 2: Choose Significance Level**
  - Set **α = 0.05** (5% significance level).

- **Step 3: Collect Data and Compute Test Statistic**
  - Suppose we measure blood pressure in 100 patients after taking the drug.
  - Compute the test statistic (e.g., *t-score* or *z-score*).

- **Step 4: Calculate p-value**
  - If **p-value < 0.05**, we reject *H₀*.

- **Step 5: Conclusion**
  - If *H₀* is rejected, we conclude that the drug **significantly lowers blood pressure**.

#### Common Hypothesis Tests

| Test Type         | Used For                                      | Example |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------|
| **Z-test**       | Large sample, known variance               | Checking if a factory’s production mean is different from 50 kg. |
| **T-test**       | Small sample, unknown variance             | Comparing two teaching methods' effectiveness. |
| **Chi-square test** | Categorical data                           | Checking if gender and voting preference are related. |
| **ANOVA**        | Comparing multiple groups                  | Testing if three diets lead to different weight loss. |

## Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) and Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_1 \))

In statistics, hypothesis testing is used to make decisions about a population based on sample data. It involves two competing hypotheses:

#### 1. Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \))
- The **default assumption** or status quo.
- It assumes that there is **no effect, no difference, or no relationship** in the population.
- We test whether there is enough evidence to **reject** \( H_0 \) in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

##### Example: Drug Effectiveness
- \( H_0 \): The new drug has **no effect** on blood pressure (same as a placebo).
- \( H_0: \mu_{\text{new drug}} = \mu_{\text{placebo}} \).

#### 2. Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_1 \))
- The **opposite claim** of the null hypothesis.
- It represents what we are trying to **prove or find evidence for**.
- If there is sufficient statistical evidence, we reject \( H_0 \) in favor of \( H_1 \).

##### Example: Drug Effectiveness
- \( H_1 \): The new drug **lowers** blood pressure.
- \( H_1: \mu_{\text{new drug}} < \mu_{\text{placebo}} \) *(One-tailed test)*.

---

## Types of Hypothesis Tests

#### 1. One-Tailed Test
- Tests for an effect in **one direction only** (e.g., drug lowers blood pressure).
- **Example:**
  - \( H_0: \mu = 100 \)
  - \( H_1: \mu < 100 \)

#### 2. Two-Tailed Test
- Tests for an effect in **either direction** (e.g., drug changes blood pressure, either increases or decreases).
- **Example:**
  - \( H_0: \mu = 100 \)
  - \( H_1: \mu \neq 100 \)

##### Example: Coin Toss (Fairness Test)

Suppose you want to test if a coin is fair (unbiased).

- **Null Hypothesis** (\( H_0 \)): The coin is fair, i.e., \( P(\text{Heads}) = 0.5 \).
- **Alternative Hypothesis** (\( H_1 \)): The coin is biased, i.e., \( P(\text{Heads}) \neq 0.5 \) *(Two-tailed test)*.

If you flip the coin 100 times and get 80 heads, you might reject \( H_0 \), concluding the coin is biased.

## Type I and Type II Errors

In hypothesis testing, we test a null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) against an alternative hypothesis (\( H_1 \)). The outcome of the test can lead to two types of errors:

#### 1. Type I Error (False Positive)
- Occurs when we **reject** the null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) when it is actually **true**.
- Probability of Type I error = \( \alpha \) (significance level of the test).
- **Example**: A medical test incorrectly indicates a patient has a disease when they are actually healthy.

#### 2. Type II Error (False Negative)
- Occurs when we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) when it is actually **false**.
- Probability of Type II error = \( \beta \).
- **Power of the test** = \( 1 - \beta \) (probability of correctly rejecting \( H_0 \)).
- **Example**: A medical test fails to detect a disease in a patient who actually has it.

#### Trade-Off Between Type I and Type II Errors
- Lowering \( \alpha \) (reducing Type I error) generally increases \( \beta \) (increasing Type II error), and vice versa.
- The balance depends on the problem: In medical testing, minimizing Type II errors (false negatives) is often more critical.

#### Example: COVID-19 Testing

Let's say we are testing individuals for COVID-19 using a diagnostic test. We define the hypotheses as:

- **Null Hypothesis** (\( H_0 \)): The person **does not** have COVID-19.
- **Alternative Hypothesis** (\( H_1 \)): The person **has** COVID-19.

Now, let's see what happens in different scenarios:

##### 1. Type I Error (False Positive)
- The test **incorrectly detects COVID-19** in a healthy person.
- The person actually **does not** have COVID-19, but the test **says they do**.
- **Consequence**: The person may be wrongly quarantined, experience unnecessary anxiety, and receive unnecessary treatment.

##### 2. Type II Error (False Negative)
- The test **fails to detect COVID-19** in an infected person.
- The person actually **has** COVID-19, but the test **says they are healthy**.
- **Consequence**: The infected person continues interacting with others, spreading the virus unknowingly.

##### Balancing the Errors
- If we make the test **more sensitive** (reducing false negatives), we might get **more false positives** (higher Type I error).
- If we make the test **more specific** (reducing false positives), we might get **more false negatives** (higher Type II error).
- In public health, it is usually **better to reduce Type II errors** (false negatives) because missing actual COVID-19 cases can have serious consequences.
